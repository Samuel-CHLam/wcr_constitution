<h1 id="wcr-charity-policy">WCR Charity policy</h1>

<section>
The Weir Common Room Constitution states that the WCR may dedicate in
its budget up to &#163;500 per academic year for charitable donations. In
making use of these funds, the WCR shall refer to the following
guidelines:
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">1.</div>
  <div>The WCR may consider making a donation to any charity in which
    one or more WCR members is/are directly involved. This includes
    sponsoring WCR members for their direct participation in fundraising
    events for charity (i.e. Races, cycling events, etc.).</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">2.</div>
  <div>The WCR committee shall proceed through a call for applications
    at any time during Hillary term each year.</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">3.</div>
  <div>The WCR committe (preferably through its Treasurer or Diversity,
    Equality, and Welfare Officers) shall advertise the call for
    applications, requirements and deadline to all WCR members.</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">4.</div>
  <div>Applications should be submitted via email or pidged to the
    Treasurer or Diversity, Equality, and Welfare Officers before the
    advertised deadline.</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">5.</div>
  <div>Applications shall be no more than one page long and minimally
    include the following:
    <ul>
      <li>The name of the (lead) WCR member;</li>
      <li>The name of the charity, including full contact details and website (if available);</li>
      <li>A short description of the charity's objectives and activities;</li>
      <li>A short description of the WCR member's involvement with the organization;</li>
      <li>A short description of the projected use of the WCR's financial contribution.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">6.</div>
  <div>The WCR committee shall evaluate applications and make decisions
    within 2 weeks of the deadline. It shall inform the successful
    applicants by email and advertise the outcome to all WCR
    members.</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">7.</div>
  <div>Each member of the WCR may submit only one application (for one
    charity), individually or as part of a group, per academic year. A
    maximum donation from the WCR is set at &#163;50 per WCR member, or &#163;100 per
    project or charity (in case of group applications).</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">8.</div>
  <div>Budgeted funds do not have to be entirely allocated each year. In
    the absence of suitable applications, the WCR committee can decide not
    to make any donation and make these sums available for other similar
    purposes, make a new call for applications in Trinity term or decide
    upon another appropriate use of this portfolio.</div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="index">9.</div>
  <div>The WCR committee may exceptionally consider unsolicited
    applications at other moments in the academic year (e.g. for fundraising
    events happening in MT or TT). Such applications shall follow the
    guidelines above. The committee may decide favourably even if the
    budgeted sums have already been allocated, as long as the total WCR
    contributions for the academic year have not reached a maximum of
    &#163;500.</div>
